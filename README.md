# React Eight Ball

I was tasked with creating a magic eigth ball that chooses a random message when it is clicked on. When clicked it should also change the background color of the ball. Another requirement was to have the EightBall component accept a single property, answers, which is an array of objects, with each object having a key for msg and color.
